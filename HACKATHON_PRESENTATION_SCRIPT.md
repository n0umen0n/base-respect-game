# üéÆ Respect Game - 2 Minute Hackathon Presentation Script

**Total Time: 2:00 minutes**

---

## SCREEN 1: Opening (0:00 - 0:15)

**Visual:** Landing page with leaderboard showing top 6 members

**Script:**
"Web3 governance is broken. Token-based systems create plutocracies where wealthy voters control everything. Subjective systems reward politics over contribution. We built Respect Game to fix this."

---

## SCREEN 2: The Solution (0:15 - 0:30)

**Visual:** Hover over "Connect Wallet" button, show game flow diagram if available

**Script:**
"Respect Game is governance disguised as a fun weekly game. Members submit contributions, rank their peers in drag-and-drop interface, and automatically earn RESPECT tokens based on peer evaluation. The top contributors become governors‚Äîno elections, no token buying, pure meritocracy."

---

## SCREEN 3: Profile Creation (0:30 - 0:45)

**Visual:** Profile creation page, fill out form (name, bio, optional X account)

**Script:**
"Here's how it works. First, you create your on-chain profile. Everything is gasless‚Äîwe sponsor all transactions using smart wallets on Base, so there's zero friction for users."

---

## SCREEN 4: Submit Contributions (0:45 - 1:00)

**Visual:** Contribution submission page, show multiple contribution inputs, countdown timer

**Script:**
"Every week during the contribution phase, members submit what they built‚Äîcode, designs, community work, anything valuable. You can add multiple contributions with proof of work links."

---

## SCREEN 5: Ranking Interface (1:00 - 1:15)

**Visual:** Ranking page with drag-and-drop cards, reorder them, expand to view contributions

**Script:**
"Then comes the fun part‚Äîthe ranking game. You're randomly grouped with 4 other members. Drag and drop to rank your peers' contributions. It's intuitive, engaging, and actually fun. We use Fractal Governance's consensus algorithm to prevent gaming."

---

## SCREEN 6: Profile Page & Results (1:15 - 1:30)

**Visual:** Profile page showing RESPECT score, game history table, token balance

**Script:**
"After ranking, RESPECT tokens are automatically distributed. First place gets 60, second gets 40, and so on. Your average RESPECT score over recent games determines your rank. All history is permanently recorded on-chain and indexed in our Supabase database."

---

## SCREEN 7: Governance (1:30 - 1:45)

**Visual:** Proposals page with color-coded proposals (green for approval, red for ban, blue for treasury)

**Script:**
"The top 6 members form the governing multisig. They vote on member approvals, bans, and treasury proposals. Green is member approval‚Äîneeds 2 votes. Red is banning‚Äîneeds 3. Blue is treasury‚Äîneeds 4. Governance emerges naturally from the game."

---

## SCREEN 8: Tech Stack & Close (1:45 - 2:00)

**Visual:** Quick flash through: code editor showing smart contracts, then architecture diagram or GitHub repo

**Script:**
"We built a complete full-stack dApp: upgradeable Solidity contracts on Base, React frontend with TypeScript, real-time Alchemy webhooks syncing to Supabase, Privy for social login, and Pimlico for gasless transactions. Over 3,000 lines of production code.

Respect Game makes governance fun, fair, and corruption-resistant. Thank you!"

## üéØ Presentation Tips

### Pacing

- **Speak clearly but with energy** - You have exactly 120 seconds
- **Practice with a timer** - Aim for 115 seconds to have buffer
- **Don't rush the demo** - Let visual moments breathe for 2-3 seconds

### Screen Transitions

- **Pre-load all tabs** - Have everything ready in browser tabs
- **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Cmd+Tab (Mac) or Alt+Tab (Windows)
- **Order tabs left to right** - Match script order exactly

### Energy & Delivery

- **Start strong** - "Web3 governance is broken" grabs attention
- **Show enthusiasm** - This is a game; make it fun!
- **Make eye contact** - Look at judges, not screen
- **End with confidence** - Pause after "Thank you!"

### What Makes This Strong

‚úÖ **Problem ‚Üí Solution** - Clear narrative arc  
‚úÖ **Live Demo** - Shows working product, not slides  
‚úÖ **Technical Depth** - Smart contracts, webhooks, full-stack  
‚úÖ **Unique Value** - "Governance disguised as a game"  
‚úÖ **User Experience** - Emphasize gasless, drag-and-drop, fun  
‚úÖ **On Base** - Highlight Base ecosystem

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't read monotone** - Vary your pace and energy  
‚ùå **Don't skip the problem** - Judges need context  
‚ùå **Don't get stuck on one screen** - Keep moving  
‚ùå **Don't apologize for bugs** - Only demo working features  
‚ùå **Don't go over time** - They WILL cut you off

## üé¨ Pre-Demo Checklist

### Technical Setup

- [ ] Clear browser cache (fast load times)
- [ ] Connect wallet in advance
- [ ] Have test profile created
- [ ] Pre-fill contribution form (for speed)
- [ ] Have ranking group with peers ready
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs
- [ ] Turn off notifications
- [ ] Zoom to 100% (readable on projector)
- [ ] Test audio/video if remote

### Tab Order (Left to Right)

1. Landing page (logged out)
2. Profile creation page
3. Contribution submission page
4. Ranking page
5. Profile page (with history)
6. Proposals page
7. GitHub repo or architecture diagram

### Backup Plan

- [ ] Have screenshots ready (in case wallet won't connect)
- [ ] Record video walkthrough (if live demo fails)
- [ ] Have contract addresses written down
- [ ] Know your deployed URLs

## üé§ Opening Variations (Choose Your Style)

### High Energy

"Web3 governance is completely broken‚Äîand everyone knows it. Rich people buy tokens and control DAOs. We built Respect Game to end plutocracy with a weekly game that's actually fun."

### Technical

"Current governance systems optimize for token ownership, not contribution. Respect Game uses peer-evaluated rankings and a consensus algorithm to create merit-based governance on Base."

### Story-Based

"Imagine joining a DAO and watching one whale out-vote 1,000 contributors. That's web3 governance today. Respect Game fixes this by making governance emerge from a weekly ranking game."

---

## üèÜ Closing Variations

### Call to Action

"Respect Game is live on Base Sepolia. Try the demo, join our community, and help us build governance that's actually fair. Thank you!"

### Vision-Based

"We're building the reputation layer for web3‚Äîstarting with communities that want fair governance. Respect Game is the future. Thank you!"

### Technical Flex

"Full source code is on GitHub‚Äîupgradeable contracts, comprehensive tests, complete frontend. We shipped a production-ready dApp. Thank you!"
