# ‚úÖ Webhook Active - Configuration Checklist

## Good News

Your webhook exists and is active in Alchemy! üéâ

## Now Verify These Exact Details

### 1. Check Webhook URL (CRITICAL)

**In Alchemy webhook settings, the URL should be EXACTLY:**

```
https://www.respectgame.app/api/webhook-respect-game
```

**Common mistakes that break webhooks:**

- ‚ùå `http://` instead of `https://`
- ‚ùå Missing `api/`: `https://www.respectgame.app/webhook-respect-game`
- ‚ùå Wrong endpoint name: `webhook-graphql` or `webhook`
- ‚ùå Trailing slash: `https://www.respectgame.app/api/webhook-respect-game/`
- ‚ùå Old Vercel URL: `*.vercel.app` instead of custom domain
- ‚ùå Typo in domain: `respectgame` vs `respect-game`

**ACTION:** Copy this URL and paste it exactly in Alchemy:

```
https://www.respectgame.app/api/webhook-respect-game
```

---

### 2. Check Network

**Your contracts are deployed on:**

- Network: **Base Sepolia**

**Alchemy webhook MUST be on the same network:**

- ‚úÖ Base Sepolia (correct)
- ‚ùå Base Mainnet (wrong - different network)
- ‚ùå Ethereum Mainnet (wrong - different chain)
- ‚ùå Ethereum Sepolia (wrong - different chain)

**ACTION:** Verify webhook shows **"Base Sepolia"** as the network.

---

### 3. Check Webhook Type

**Should be:**

- ‚úÖ GraphQL Webhook
- ‚úÖ Address Activity Webhook

**NOT:**

- ‚ùå Custom Webhook (deprecated in some regions)

**ACTION:** Verify it's a GraphQL or Address Activity webhook.

---

### 4. Check Contract Addresses in Query

**Your deployed contracts (VERIFY THESE ARE CORRECT):**

```
RespectGameCore:  0x8a8dbE61A0368855a455eeC806bCFC40C9e95c29
Governance:       0x354d6b039f6d463b706a63f18227eb34d4fc93aA
```

**In Alchemy GraphQL query, addresses MUST be lowercase:**

```graphql
{
  block {
    logs(
      filter: {
        addresses: [
          "0x8a8dbe61a0368855a455eec806bcfc40c9e95c29"
          "0x354d6b039f6d463b706a63f18227eb34d4fc93aa"
        ]
      }
    ) {
      account {
        address
      }
      topics
      data
      transaction {
        hash
      }
      transactionHash
    }
  }
}
```

**ACTION:**

1. Copy the GraphQL query from Alchemy
2. Verify the addresses match (lowercase)
3. If wrong, update them

---

### 5. Test the Webhook

**In Alchemy Dashboard:**

1. Click on your webhook
2. Find **"Send Test Event"** or **"Test Webhook"** button
3. Click it

**Expected result:**

- ‚úÖ **200 OK** response
- ‚úÖ Shows in "Recent Deliveries" with 200 status

**If you get an error:**

- **401 Unauthorized:** Signing key mismatch (we can fix this)
- **404 Not Found:** URL is wrong
- **500 Server Error:** There's an issue (check Vercel logs)
- **Timeout:** Connection issue

**ACTION:** Click "Send Test Event" and tell me what happens.

---

### 6. Check Recent Deliveries

**In Alchemy Dashboard:**

1. Go to your webhook
2. Click **"Recent Deliveries"** or **"Deliveries"** tab
3. Look at the history

**What do you see?**

- ‚úÖ **Recent entries with 200 status:** Working!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Old entries with 200, nothing recent:** No blockchain activity
- ‚ùå **Entries with 401/404/500:** Configuration issue
- ‚ùå **No entries at all:** Webhook never triggered or no activity

**ACTION:** Check what's in Recent Deliveries and let me know.

## Quick Test Right Now

Let's test if Alchemy can reach your endpoint:

**Step 1:** In a terminal, start watching logs:

```bash
cd "/Users/vlad/untitled folder/vladrespect"
vercel logs --follow
```

**Step 2:** In Alchemy dashboard, click **"Send Test Event"**

**Step 3:** Look at the logs

**You should see:**

```
üé£ Webhook received!
Method: POST
Headers: {...}
‚úÖ Signature verified
üìã Processing GraphQL webhook...
```

**If you see nothing in logs:**

- Alchemy isn't reaching your endpoint
- URL in Alchemy is wrong

**If you see errors in logs:**

- Endpoint is reached but there's an issue
- We can fix it based on the error

---

## Alternative Test: Use Direct Vercel URL

To rule out custom domain issues, try updating the webhook to use the direct Vercel URL:

**In Alchemy, temporarily change webhook URL to:**

```
https://base-respect-game-cpnyjrzrd-vladislav-hramtsovs-projects.vercel.app/api/webhook-respect-game
```

Then test again. If this works but `www.respectgame.app` doesn't, there's a routing issue with the custom domain.

## Most Common Issues When Webhook is Active but Not Called

### Issue 1: URL Has Typo

**Check:** Webhook URL in Alchemy
**Fix:** Update to exact URL above

### Issue 2: No Blockchain Activity

**Check:** Are there any transactions on your contracts?
**Fix:** Trigger a test transaction:

```bash
cd blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/test-member-join.ts --network base-sepolia
```

### Issue 3: Wrong Contract Addresses

**Check:** Addresses in GraphQL query
**Fix:** Update to match your deployed contracts (lowercase)

### Issue 4: Signing Key Mismatch (but this causes 401, not "no calls")

**Check:** Recent Deliveries shows 401 errors
**Fix:** Update signing key in Vercel
