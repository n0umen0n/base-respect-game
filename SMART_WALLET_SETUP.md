# Smart Wallet + Paymaster Gas Sponsorship Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up smart wallets with Pimlico paymaster to sponsor gas fees for your users on Base network.

## What Changed

Previously, you were using Privy's native gas sponsorship with `useSendTransaction` and the `sponsor: true` flag. This has been replaced with:

- **Smart Wallets (Account Abstraction)**: Using Pimlico's permissionless library
- **Paymaster**: Pimlico paymaster service to sponsor gas fees
- **Simple Smart Account**: ERC-4337 compliant smart account with your Privy embedded wallet as the signer

## Architecture

```
User's Privy Embedded Wallet (Signer)
         â†“
Simple Smart Account (ERC-4337)
         â†“
Pimlico Bundler + Paymaster
         â†“
Base Network (On-chain transaction with sponsored gas)
```

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Pimlico API Key

1. Go to [Pimlico Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/)
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your API key
5. Update the API key in `src/hooks/useSmartWallet.tsx`:

```typescript
const PIMLICO_API_KEY = "YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY"; // Replace this!
```

### 2. Configure Paymaster Policies (Optional)

In the Pimlico dashboard, you can configure:

- **Spending Limits**: Maximum gas per transaction/day/month
- **Whitelisted Contracts**: Only sponsor transactions to specific contracts
- **Rate Limits**: Limit number of transactions per user

### 3. Fund Your Paymaster (if using custom setup)

If you're using Pimlico's Verifying Paymaster on testnet, you may need to fund it:

1. In Pimlico Dashboard, find your paymaster address
2. Send Base ETH to that address
3. The paymaster will use these funds to pay for users' gas

**Note**: Pimlico offers free sponsorship on testnets and starter plans for mainnet.

### 4. Alternative: Use Other Paymaster Providers

Instead of Pimlico, you can use:

#### **Alchemy Gas Manager**

```typescript
import { createAlchemySmartAccountClient } from "@alchemy/aa-alchemy";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const client = await createAlchemySmartAccountClient({
  chain: base,
  policyId: "YOUR_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID",
  signer: viemWallet,
});
```

#### **Biconomy Paymaster**

```typescript
import { createSmartAccountClient } from "@biconomy/account";

const smartAccount = await createSmartAccountClient({
  signer: viemWallet,
  paymasterUrl: "YOUR_BICONOMY_PAYMASTER_URL",
});
```

## How It Works

### 1. Smart Wallet Creation

When a user logs in, the `useSmartWallet` hook:

- Gets their Privy embedded wallet
- Creates a Simple Smart Account using their embedded wallet as the signer
- Sets up a Pimlico bundler and paymaster

### 2. Transaction Flow

When sending a transaction:

1. User signs the transaction with their embedded wallet (off-chain)
2. The smart account wraps it in a UserOperation
3. The paymaster sponsors the gas fee
4. The bundler submits it to the network
5. Transaction executes on-chain with zero gas cost to the user

### 3. Key Benefits

- âœ… **Gas Sponsorship**: Users don't pay any gas fees
- âœ… **Batch Transactions**: Multiple operations in one transaction
- âœ… **Session Keys**: Enable gasless gaming/DeFi interactions
- âœ… **Recovery**: Social recovery options (future enhancement)

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/hooks/useSmartWallet.tsx` (NEW)

Custom hook that:

- Creates a smart account using Privy embedded wallet as signer
- Configures Pimlico bundler and paymaster
- Returns the smart account client for transactions

### 2. `/src/components/ContractInteractor.tsx` (UPDATED)

- Removed `useSendTransaction` hook
- Added `useSmartWallet` hook
- Updated transaction logic to use `smartAccountClient.writeContract()`
- Added smart wallet status indicators in UI

## Testing

1. **Start your dev server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log in with Privy** and navigate to the dashboard

3. **Wait for smart wallet setup** (shows "ðŸ”„ Setting up smart wallet...")

4. **Once ready**, you'll see:

   - Smart wallet address
   - Signer address (your embedded wallet)

5. **Enter a number and click "Set Number (Gas Sponsored via Paymaster)"**

6. **Sign the transaction** when prompted (this is just signing, not paying gas!)

7. **Wait for confirmation** - the transaction will be bundled and sponsored

8. **Check BaseScan** to verify the transaction (gas paid by paymaster)

## Troubleshooting

### "Paymaster error: Check your Pimlico API key"

- Verify you've replaced `YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY` in `useSmartWallet.tsx`
- Check your API key is valid in Pimlico dashboard

### "Insufficient funds: The paymaster may not have enough funds"

- Fund your paymaster address on Base network
- Or use Pimlico's free sponsorship tier

### "Smart wallet is not ready yet"

- Wait for the setup to complete (can take 2-3 seconds on first load)
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### "User rejected the request"

- User needs to sign the transaction with their embedded wallet
- This is just a signature, no gas is charged

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Smart Account Factory

You can use different smart account implementations:

```typescript
// Using Kernel instead of Simple Account
import { toKernelSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts";

const kernelAccount = await toKernelSmartAccount({
  client: publicClient,
  entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
  owner: viemWallet,
});
```

### Conditional Gas Sponsorship

Sponsor only specific functions:

```typescript
const shouldSponsor = (tx) => {
  // Only sponsor setNumber, not other functions
  return tx.data.includes('setNumber');
};

// In paymaster config
paymaster: shouldSponsor(tx) ? pimlicoClient : undefined,
```

### Session Keys (Advanced)

Enable gasless transactions without user signatures:

```typescript
import { toPermissionValidator } from "permissionless/accounts";

const sessionKey = await toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
  kernelVersion: "0.3.0",
  signer: sessionKeySigner,
});
```

## Cost Considerations

### Pimlico Pricing (as of 2024)

- **Testnet**: Free unlimited sponsorship
- **Mainnet Free Tier**: 50,000 sponsored operations/month
- **Pro Tier**: $99/month + per-transaction fee
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

### Gas Savings

- Traditional transaction: User pays ~$0.50-$5 in gas (depending on network congestion)
- Smart wallet + paymaster: User pays $0, you pay ~$0.30-$3 per transaction

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch transactions** to reduce per-transaction costs
2. **Set spending limits** in Pimlico dashboard
3. **Whitelist contracts** to only sponsor your app's contracts
4. **Use rate limits** to prevent abuse

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Get Pimlico API key and update the code
2. âœ… Test on Base network
3. ðŸ”„ Monitor usage in Pimlico dashboard
4. ðŸ”„ Set up spending limits and policies
5. ðŸ”„ Deploy to production when ready
