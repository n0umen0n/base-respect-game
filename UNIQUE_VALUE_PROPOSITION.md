# Respect Game: Unique Value Proposition

---

**Respect Game's unique value: Governance made fun.**

---

## What Makes Us Different

**Respect game uniquely provides system where governance emerges from a game people actually want to play.**

### The False Choice Web3 Faces

Current solutions force you to pick your poison:

- **Token voting** → Plutocratic, boring, low participation
- **Centralized control** → Not actually decentralized
- **Complex mechanisms** (delegates, optimistic) → High friction, rational ignorance

**Respect Game offers a third way:** Merit based governance that's actually fun to participate in.

### How We Do It

**Package governance as a weekly game:**

1. **Submit contributions** (show off your work)
2. **Rank 4 peers** (see what others built, drag-and-drop interface)
3. **Earn RESPECT tokens** (immediate reward)
4. **Top 6 govern automatically** (no elections, power emerges from the game)


**The magic:** People participate because they want to, not because they have to.

**Governance disguised as a game. Infrastructure built as a side effect.**
