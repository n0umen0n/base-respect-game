# Respect Game: Problems Solved

## The Core Problem

**Communities have no effective way to self-organize without corruption, and no scalable system to fund public goods.**

From the [Fractally whitepaper](https://fractally.com/uploads/Fractally%20White%20Paper%201.0.pdf):

> "The challenge all societies face is ensuring the vast majority of surplus value created by voluntary collaboration is realized by the contributors instead of a governing elite. If we make it profitable to contribute to public goods, then we will unleash a powerful force for human advancement."

This manifests as four interconnected failures:

## The Four Failure Modes

### 1. **Governance Gets Corrupted**

Power consistently flows to the wrong people:

- **Plutocracy**: Token holders control decisions, not contributors
- **Favoritism**: Leaders handpick allies, not proven performers
- **Gaming**: Short-term metric farming beats sustained value creation
- **Rational ignorance**: Voters stay uninformed because learning costs exceed vote value
- **No legitimacy**: Governors haven't earned community trust

**Problem:** Communities can't make good decisions or scale trust.

---

### 2. **Contributors Go Unrecognized**

Humans psychologically need acknowledgment, yet most communities don't have a system to provide it:

- Work gets noticed based on luck, not value
- Behind-the-scenes contributions remain invisible
- No tangible proof of impact
- Recognition is fleeting and hollow (likes, retweets)
- Past contributions fade from memory

**Problem:** Contributors burn out, feel undervalued, and leave.

---

### 3. **Synergies Remain Untapped**

The highest value comes from contributor collaboration, but it rarely happens:

- Contributors work in silos
- Complementary skills never connect
- Collaboration depends on random encounters
- Duplicated effortâ€”multiple people solving the same problem
- No peer review or knowledge sharing

**Problem:** Communities operate at a fraction of their potential.

### 4. **Reputation Doesn't Transfer**

Web3 lacks working reputation infrastructure:

- Discord roles, GitHub starsâ€”all platform-locked and non-transferable
- POAPs and badges are trivially gameable
- Sybil attacks (fake accounts) are cheap and easy
- No trust primitive for applications to build on
- Every new context requires rebuilding trust from zero

**Problem:** Web3 is stuck with plutocracy (token voting) or centralization (KYC).

## The Vicious Cycle

Without a system for non-corruptive self-organization:

**Corrupted governance** â†’ bad decisions â†’ value creators leave  
**Unrecognized contributors** â†’ burnout â†’ community decay  
**Missed synergies** â†’ low output â†’ wasted potential  
**Fragmented reputation** â†’ constant cold starts â†’ coordination failure

**Result:** Public goods remain chronically underfunded because contributors can't capture the value they create.

---

## What's Needed

A system that enables communities to self-organize and fund public goods by:

- Awarding governance rights through peer-validated contribution
- Providing systematic, meaningful recognition
- Creating visibility that enables collaboration
- Building portable, composable reputation infrastructure

All while remaining **resistant to corruption, gaming, and capture**.
