# Respect Game: Distribution Strategy (Alpha)

---

## Our Approach

**Person-to-person meetings with Base builders, inviting them to play the game.** We attend events where Base contributors gather, conduct personalized outreach, and connect with builders in Incubase to invite them to participate. This direct approach ensures we recruit quality participants who understand the value and are likely to commit long-term.

## Why This Fits

**Product requires community:** Respect Game needs peers to rank and actual contributions to evaluateâ€”it doesn't work with random solo users.

**Alpha needs quality:** We need 20-50 committed builders who show up weekly, not 1000 people who try it once and leave.

**Base alignment:** We're deployed on Base, and the ecosystem has builders (not just speculators) who understand governance problems.

**Person-to-person works:** Direct outreach creates real relationships and commitment. You can't fake organic community with paid ads.

**Other strategies come later:** Paid acquisition, viral mechanics, and partnerships make sense after we prove the model works with a small cohesive group.
