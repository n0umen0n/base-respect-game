## How it Works

This bridge allows you to:

- Transfer tokens between Base and Solana
- Send arbitrary cross-chain messages
- Deploy wrapped tokens on either chain

> [!NOTE]
>
> For native Ethereum ↔ Base bridging, see [our official docs](https://docs.base.org/base-chain/network-information/bridges-mainnet).

## Usage

### Base → Solana

Send tokens or messages from Base to Solana (multi-step process):

```bash
cd base
# See base/README.md for detailed instructions
```

After initiating on Base, wait ~15 minutes for an updated root to be posted to Solana and complete the transfer with prove + finalize steps:

```bash
cd solana
# See solana/README.md for prove and finalize instructions
```

### Solana → Base

Send tokens or messages from Solana to Base:

```bash
cd solana
# See solana/README.md for detailed instructions
```
