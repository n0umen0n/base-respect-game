 # Respect Game: What Problem It Solves
---
## The Core Problem

**Communities have no effective way to self organize without getting corrupted, and no scalable system to fund public goods.**

When people collaborate, they create value greater than the sum of individual contributions. But this surplus value typically gets captured by governing elites rather than the contributors who created it. Without a fair system to recognize and reward contributions, public goods remain chronically underfunded.

## How Respect Game Solves It

Respect Game creates a **corruption resistant system** for communities to self organize and fairly reward contributors through:

1. **Peer evaluated contributions** - Your peers (who see your work) rank your contributions every game cycle
2. **Algorithmic fairness** - RESPECT tokens distributed automatically based on peer rankings
3. **Merit-based governance** - Top contributors (by recently gained RESPECT) earn voting rights
4. **Onchain reputation** - Permanent, verifiable record of contributions and peer evaluation

## What You Can Use It For

### For Community Members

**Submit & Get Recognized**

- Submit contributions each cycle (weekly)
- Get ranked by peers who actually see your work
- Earn RESPECT tokens based on peer evaluation
- Build permanent on-chain reputation

**Collaborate & Discover**

- See what other members are working on
- Find complementary skills for partnerships
- Get peer feedback on your work
- Build real relationships through repeated interaction

**Govern & Decide**
- Top contributors form a multisig and can vote on proposals
- Execute any on-chain transactions via multisig

### For Communities

**Fair Compensation**

- Automatically distribute rewards based on peer evaluation
- Transparent algorithm everyone can verify

**Quality Governance**

- Governing body emerges from proven contributors
- No token-buying or political maneuvering
- Decisions made by people who've earned trust

**Track Contributions**

- Permanent record of all contributions and rankings
- Historical data for every member

## How It Makes Tasks Easier/Safer

### Easier: Distributing Rewards

**Before:** Spreadsheets, arguments about who deserves what, subjective founder decisions, complex work evaluation systems
**After:** Submit contributions → Peers rank → Tokens distributed automatically

### Easier: Identifying Contributors

**Before:** Guessing who's valuable based on visibility or politics  
**After:** RESPECT score shows sustained peer-evaluated contribution


### Safer: Treasury Management

**Before:** Plutocracy, or centralized control of treasury.
**After:** Meritocracy

### Safer: Proving Your Work

**Before:** Claims with no proof, reputation locked in each platform  
**After:** Immutable on-chain record, portable across communities

## Real-World Use Cases

**DAOs & Web3 Communities**

- Fairly compensate contributors beyond simple token gated voting
- Build legitimate governance without plutocracy

**Open Source Projects**

- Reward documentation, support, and coordination (not just code commits)
- Identify who actually contributes vs who just comments

**Creator Collectives**

- Split revenue based on peer evaluated contributions
- Recognize non-obvious work (moderation, organization)

**Gaming Guilds**

- Rank contributions beyond just gameplay stats
- Reward community builders and organizers

**Local Communities**

- Track volunteer contributions transparently
- Democratically elect leaders based on sustained contribution

---

## Bottom Line

Respect Game gives communities a **practical tool** to:

✅ **Recognize** contributors systematically  
✅ **Reward** them fairly through peer evaluation  
✅ **Govern** through earned merit, not purchased tokens  
✅ **Prove** contributions with portable on-chain reputation

All while remaining **resistant to corruption, gaming, and capture**.
